# Experiments

Torch-Uncertainty proposes various benchmarks to evaluate uncertainty quantification methods. To ease the maintenance
of the repository, the number of configuration files has been reduced. However, we include more configs in various repos
in the [Torch-Uncertainty](https://github.com/torch-uncertainty) organization such as:

- [The Packed-Ensembles reproducibility repository](https://github.com/torch-uncertainty/packed-ensembles-ICLR-experiments)
- [The Torch-Uncertainty reproducibility repository](https://github.com/torch-uncertainty/torch-uncertainty-neurIPS-experiments)
- [The UCI regression benchmark repository](https://github.com/torch-uncertainty/uci-regression-experiment)
